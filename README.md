# Downloader Benchmark

benchmark tests for [Splash](https://github.com/scrapinghub/splash) and 
[Selenium](https://www.seleniumhq.org/) with urls in `urls.txt`

## How to Run

Use `python3 run.py` to run, it will benchmark the urls in `urls.txt` 

Checkour the results in [run1_report.txt](run1_report.txt), 
[run2_report.txt](run2_report.txt) and [run3_report.txt](run3_report.txt) for the 3 iterations of 
benchmark we did.
